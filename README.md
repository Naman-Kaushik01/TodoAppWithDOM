# 📝 TODO App with JavaScript DOM

This is a simple and minimal TODO list application built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM manipulation). It allows users to:

- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks with a click

No external libraries or frameworks are used—just pure JavaScript!

## 🚀 Features

- Add a task by typing in the input and clicking the "Add" button.
- Delete tasks using the "Delete" button next to each item.
- Instant UI updates thanks to DOM manipulation.

🧠 How It Works
User types a task into the input field.

On clicking the button:

A new <li> element is created with the task's text.

A "Delete" button is appended to that <li>.

The item is added to the list.

On clicking the "Delete" button:

The specific list item is removed from the DOM.
